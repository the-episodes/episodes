## situation

#### vitaal ship

- an alien ship (Vitaal, highly develped civilaztion, with high standards) is hovering over Earth
- the vitaal are contantly on the fence: whether to shoot down/destoy Earth or not, sighing, faceplaming and tempted to pull the trigger (which will completely annihilate the planet)
- no commmunication or threats, they are just pondering by themselves

#### an alien internet company 

- is behind vitaal ship, they are pithcing to vitaal to connect Earth to starnet (galactic internet) - new clients, potential
- they are trying hard, dancing there way around not to lose a new planet-client and not to anger vitaal

#### people are building walls, fortifications

- people with dumb persuasion bulding walls and fortifications, when it is clear that the alien ship will smash the planet to peaces
- the suvivors from previous victim-planet landed and shared

#### another victim-planet survivors

- land on Earth and explain that vitaal have high standards
- people assemble a team of polititicians - survivors are speechless, already see another doom coming

#### film industry

- gathers a conference, best directors, actors, decide to make a movie
- but the process is in lockout - cannot agree on money, who is in charge, who's rights
- actors, directors, survivors - all pull their hair out in fury and frustration - wtf? the damn planet is about to be destroyed, and we are arguing about money and rights
- crews start shooting on their phones, scripts are written on napkins

#### some people want to escape to vitaal

- people push their hardest to learn philosophy and stuff, to please/surprise vitaal
- which are not even indicating anything, pondering annihilation of the planet, like one thinks of keeping or removing a plant from a garden

#### space missions science teams 

- are cursing and daming the vitaal - because all projects "is/was there life on coean moons" became meaningless, but people don't want to loose their projects
- so they are cursing the extra-terrestrial civilization for spoiling (before the checked all the moons) that there is life
- they are depressed and hating and whining

#### some guys want to bulild a e-spots game

- they are concerned: can they do it before vitaal shoot, but that's pretty much it
- they want to play the game (one tourney at least), so they push
- coincidentally and funny, it's the game that vitaal will appreciate and decide not to wipe the planet
